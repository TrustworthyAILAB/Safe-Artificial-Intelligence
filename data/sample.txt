Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a technology that converts unstructured natural language spoken by humans into structured language data understandable by computers. This process enables computers to comprehend the intent of sentences and accurately grasp the speaker's intentions.

In AI services, NLP plays a crucial role. It allows computers to parse natural language into morphemes, the smallest grammatical units, patterning linguistic structures to understand the overall meaning. NLP covers various tasks, including Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, which resolves ambiguities within grammatical categories, stop-word removal, machine translation, and dialogue systems.

Recently, deep learning-based NLP research has been growing. It has become possible to infer meaning from the entire context of sentences rather than just individual words. To apply deep learning, it's essential to obtain a corpus?linguistic data used for training.

Speech recognition technology based on NLP is rapidly evolving due to advancements in network and computing technologies capable of storing large-scale voice data and processing it in real-time. The core of speech recognition technology is maintaining continuous dialogue with the interlocutor.
